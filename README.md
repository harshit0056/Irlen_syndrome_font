Irlen Syndrome, a perceptual processing disorder affecting visual information. The goal of this font is to enhance visual perception and ease of reading for people with this condition. 
The font employs icon-based letter designs, enabling users to extract more visual information from the text, improving comprehension and reducing strain.
There are currently no specific fonts designed exclusively for Irlen Syndrome.
Design Decisions
1.	Icon-based Letters: Each letter was designed to have visual cues, such as distinct shapes, angles, or embellishments that make them more recognizable at a glance. This helps users differentiate between letters more easily, even if they experience visual distortions.
2.	Bold, Clear Lines: chose to use thick, well-defined lines in the letterforms, reducing any blurring effects or visual distortions commonly experienced by people with Irlen Syndrome.
3.	High Contrast: The font uses a high contrast between the letterforms and the background, minimizing the effect of visual overlays and increasing clarity.
4.	Spacing: Additional space between characters and words was incorporated to prevent letters from blending together, a common issue for individuals with Irlen Syndrome.
5.	Simplified Shapes: The font avoids overly complex or decorative elements to minimize confusion and ensure that each character remains easily recognizable.
6.	Capitalized letters: Since person with Irlen syndrome have perceptual information processing deficit font should be as minimal as possible hence capitalizing letters is the solution for this problem.
